## Description
The task was to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a README.md from a user's input. The readme needed to be invoked with the command
`node index.js` and populated with the following:
* At least one badge
* Project title
* Description
* Table of Contents
* Installation
* Usage
* License
* Contributing
* Tests
* Questions
* User GitHub profile picture
* User GitHub email

2. [Usage](#Usage)
3. [Licence](#License)
4. [Contributing](#Contributing)
5. [Tests](#Tests)
6. [Questions](#Questions)

## Installation
1. Install the axios and inquirer dependencies and initialise the package manager
2. Create a template literal of the readme.md file
3. Use inquirer to prompt the user with a series of questions. The answers to the questions are used to popultate the readme.
4. Make an axios call to the gitHub to get user email and profile picture.
5. Call the fs library to write the readme.md file using the information provided.

## Usage
