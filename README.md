4. [Credits](#Credits)
5. [Licence](#License)

## Installation
1. Install the axios and inquirer dependencies and initialise the package manager
2. Create a template literal of the readme.md file
3. Use inquirer to prompt the user with a series of questions. The answers to the questions are used to popultate the readme.
4. Make an axios call to the gitHub to get user email and profile picture.
5. Call the fs library to write the readme.md file using the information provided.

## Usage
